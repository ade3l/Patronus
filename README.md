## About the Product
In this pandemic, all we need to do is stay safe, but how do we do that if we don't know who's infected and who's not?
Here's PATRONUS! 
A secure and private contact tracer app that functions on bluetooth technology which detects and logs with who you came in contact with. It collects only essential data like frequent contacts, so u don't need to worry about any personal data getting in the wrong hands. Also admins can very easily set the status of someone who turns positive and the app will do the rest and set the health status of everyone that is at the risk of contamination.
